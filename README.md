## ABOUT

This is a randomizer for Bravely Default II. It's compatible with both
the Switch and Steam releases.

Play this at your own risk. I bear no responsibility if you or this
mod bricks your Switch, etc. Online functionality has NEVER been
tested. Keep it turned off.

## OPTIONS

There are various options in this randomizer:

- Job abilities (active, passive, and traits)
- Active ability costs (BP, MP, HP%, pg, etc.)
- Job stats
- Job equipment recommendations (S, A, B, ....)
- Items (chests, quests, and enemy drops and steals)
- Enemy weaknesses, resistances, etc.
- Shuffling bosses

Some quality of life options include

- Scaling exp, JP, and pg from battles.
- Free Magnifying Glasses and Teleport Stones from shops.

Some shops are automaticlly updated based on options selected. Check them out!

- Early shops include Hi-Potions and Ethers (only when shuffling job abilities)
- Early shops include attack items (only when shuffling bosses and/or their resistances)
- Early shops include all status healing items (only when shuffling bosses)

## USAGE

Download and run the executable from the Releases page. Select the
`Paks` folder of your game and select all desired options. When ready,
push the `Randomize` button. This will dump a mod and some spoiler
files in the folder `seed_####`.

#### SWITCH

The mod will be in the title ID folder, and should be directly copied
to the appropriate location on your SD card. For example, when using
atmosphere, the file should be located somewhere like this:
`\path\to\SD\card\atmosphere\contents\01006DC010326000\romfs\Sunrise-E\Content\Paks\Sunrise-E-Switch_2_P.pak`.

#### STEAM

The mod will be in the pak titled "random_P.pak". To use the pak, copy
it to the location of the original pak folder. On Windows, the mod's location should be something like:
`C:\\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\BRAVELY DEFAULT II\Bravely_Default_II\Content\Paks\random_P.pak`.


## KNOWN ISSUES AND LIMITATIONS

#### SHUFFLING CHEST BATTLES

- Chest battles will only be set when starting a new game. If you
  start from an existing save file or generate a new randomizer pak
  during a playthrough, chest battles will not get updated.

#### SHUFFLING ABILITIES

- Special Abilities (e.g. All Out Assault on the Freelancer job) will
  be very difficult to trigger normally if job abilities get
  shuffled. They are triggered by the vanilla abilities of a job,
  which will likely be elsewhere. Do not expect you'll get to use
  Special Abilities.

#### BOSS SHUFFLER

- Bosses were rescaled a bit. In my experience they were beatable, but
  they can get really brutal, especially in the early game. Select
  this option at your own risk!

- Various enemy attacks and healing abilities had to be rescaled. In
  some cases, they had to be rescaled based on either the user's or
  the targets HP. Most are done fairly (in my opinion), e.g. Roddy's
  Healara, Domenic's Bomb Arm, or Glenn's Contagion Agent. However,
  Orpheus' Stone and Glenn's Gigapotion will seem poorly balanced in
  the Halls of Tribulation because the exact same abilities are reused
  for all their battles. I chose to rescale these abilities for
  mandatory battles for the story, NOT for optional battles.

- Some enemy buff/heal abilities are hard coded for specific party
  members. The following abilities are no longer guaranteed work in
  the Halls of Tribulation: Selene's "Revive All", "Shell", and
  "Protect", Glenn's "Gigapotion", "Mega Pheonix", and "BP Tonic" and
  Gladys' "Three Steps Ahead". In the main game, the same applies for
  Gladys' "One Step Ahead".

- Some battles have specific layouts for enemies, and cannot
  accommodate certain groups. This will be most notable in fights with
  the Night's Nexus. I view this as a minor incovenience. The battles
  are still worth it!

- In battle cutscenes are not updated to account for each sprites
  animations, height, voice, etc. They can be amusing to watch, but
  they're also worth skipping.
