## ABOUT

This is a randomizer for Bravely Default II.

Play this at your own risk. I bear no responsibility if you or this
mod bricks your Switch, etc. Online functionality has NEVER been
tested. Keep it turned off.

## OPTIONS

There are various options in this randomizer:

- Job abilities (active, passive, and traits)
- Active ability costs (BP, MP, HP%, pg, etc.)
- Job stats
- Job equipment recommendations (S, A, B, ....)
- Items (chests, quests, and enemy drops and steals)
- Enemy weaknesses, resistances, etc.

Some quality of life options include

- Scaling exp, JP, and pg from battles.
- Free Magnifying Glasses and Teleport Stones from shops.
- All shops include Hi-Potions and Ethers.

## USAGE

Download and run the executable from the Releases page. Select the
`Paks` folder of your game and select all desired options. When ready,
push the `Randomize` button. This will dump a mod and some spoiler
files in the folder `seed_####`. The mod will be in the title ID
folder. Copy this folder to the approariate location on your SD card,
e.g. `/path/to/SD/card/atmosphere/contents/01006DC010326000/romfs/Sunrise-E/Content/Paks/`.
