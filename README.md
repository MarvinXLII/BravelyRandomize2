## ABOUT

This is a randomizer for Bravely Default II.

Play this at your own risk. I bear no responsibility if you or this
mod bricks your Switch, etc. Online functionality has NEVER been
tested. Keep it turned off.

## OPTIONS

There are various options in this randomizer:

- Job abilities (active, passive, and traits)
- Active ability costs (BP, MP, HP%, pg, etc.)
- Job stats
- Job equipment recommendations (S, A, B, ....)
- Items (chests, quests, and enemy drops and steals)
- Enemy weaknesses, resistances, etc.

Some quality of life options include

- Scaling exp, JP, and pg from battles.
- Free Magnifying Glasses and Teleport Stones from shops.
- All shops include Hi-Potions and Ethers.

## USAGE

Download and run the executable from the Releases page. Select the
`Paks` folder of your game and select all desired options. When ready,
push the `Randomize` button. This will dump a mod and some spoiler
files in the folder `seed_####`.

#### SWITCH

The mod will be in the title ID folder, and should be directly copied
to the appropriate location on your SD card. For example, when using
atmosphere, the file should be located somewhere like this:
`\path\to\SD\card\atmosphere\contents\01006DC010326000\romfs\Sunrise-E\Content\Paks\Sunrise-E-Switch_2_P.pak`.

#### STEAM

The mod will be in the pak titled "random_P.pak". To use the pak, copy
it to the location of the original pak folder. On Windows, the mod's location should be something like:
`C:\\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\BRAVELY DEFAULT II\Bravely_Default_II\Content\Paks\random_P.pak`.
